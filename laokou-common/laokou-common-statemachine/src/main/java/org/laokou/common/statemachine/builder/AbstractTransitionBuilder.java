/**
 * Take TransitionBuilderImpl and TransitionsBuilderImpl sharing variables and methods to
 * that abstract class, which acts as their parent, instead of having
 * TransitionsBuilderImpl inherit from TransitionsBuilderImpl. I think that the multi-flow
 * builder(TransitionsBuilderImpl) and single-flow builder(TransitionBuilderImpl) are
 * equal and not supposed to be parent-child relationship, they from, when, and perform
 * methods are not the same, and although it looks like just a set of loops but logically
 * should not be inherited over Override. ( Just as there was no relationship, why should
 * we talk to each other, say a we are not suitable). With the abstract class, multi-flow
 * and single-flow only use to focus on their respective functions are single-flow, or
 * multi-flow. Conform to a single duty.
